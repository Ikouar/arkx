    XSS Vulnerability:

1-An attacker crafts a malicious payload as the username input, containing JavaScript code.
2-When the login form is submitted, the malicious JavaScript code gets executed in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions.

    CSRF Vulnerability:

1-An attacker creates a malicious website with forms that mimic the application's endpoints, such as /login.
2-Authenticated users visiting the malicious website unknowingly submit requests to the application, leading to unauthorized actions being performed on their behalf, such as changing their password or transferring funds.
Potential Impact:

XSS Vulnerability:

1-Attackers could steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of users, deface the website, or redirect users to phishing sites.
2-Impact: Compromise of user accounts, loss of sensitive data, reputational damage.

CSRF Vulnerability:

1-Attackers could perform unauthorized actions on behalf of authenticated users, leading to data breaches, financial loss, or unauthorized modifications to user accounts or data.
2-Impact: Financial loss, data manipulation, reputational damage.
Mitigation Techniques:

XSS Vulnerability:

1-Sanitize user input by escaping HTML characters and validating input to prevent script injection.
2-Implement output encoding on all user-generated content displayed in the browser.
3-Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
CSRF Vulnerability:

Enable and properly configure CSRF protection middleware (csurf) to generate and validate CSRF tokens for each request.
Ensure that CSRF tokens are included in all relevant forms and requests.
Implement additional security measures such as SameSite cookies and anti-CSRF tokens with short validity periods.
